####  Short Description
########################################################################

Long time ago i started a project to create user interfaces for Powershell with WPF as simple as possible for everyone by using a  – POWERSHELL GUI.

Powershell GUI with Powershell GUI?! – sounds paradox – but hey – one example will be ready the whole time. :D

Many times there had been administrators, customers and friends who asked for a GUI in PS. Probably the loudest crying group had been the administrators who normally should work easily with Powershell. But IT-guys are lazy – and because of these laziness we create powerfull scripts which make life easier. And if a wonderfull looking GUI is on top of this functionality – even better!

Though you should never forget – by adding a GUI to a module / function of yours you can prevent lots of input errors by the user. The user gets happy because he can click and sees a wonderful design and you can add an additional abstraction layer preventing lots of headaches.


### Aims

The primary aims with this project had been:


######- everyone can do it
######- structured and separated code by logic
######- easy to create and deploy dialogs
######- easy to manage multiple dialogs
######- free code to use for everyone
######- examples for small and easy but also further on more complex solutions
######- preconfigured examples for some use-cases
######- as many internal functions to avoid manual work
######- no dependencies to proprietary programs
